###Game Time:

Instructor Evaluation Points: Game Time
Instructor: yung-jhun
Comments:
Game is functional.

Would like to see more integration tests ( tests that communicate what is actually going on. Not just pulse checks but you replicating situations in the game and asserting you are getting the output you want.)

loved the one test that was automated.
Game knows too much

Should probably move collision detection to the ball (for its collisions), and move to board (detecting sides and so forth)
If that doesn't make sense you could theoretically move all the collisions to another class to handle the specific collisions like to happen. ( I think the prior suggestion is better...)
Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

4 - Zero complaints
